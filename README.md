# ImAG
ImAG or Image Analysis Group. This is more like a interest group rather than a formal group affiliated to an institution. The motivation of forming such a group is to provide imaging users a platform to share their problems and solutions with others who might be interested.We suggest that users publish your developments and then share your implementations, no matter in what forms or languages. This can save othersâ€™ efforts and time even by just checking your implementations as a template. Alternatively, researchers can collaborate on a specific topic to work out some solutions. The eventual goal is to have dynamically growing and accumulating open-source resource for imaging users. We hope this can help users to remove technical hurdles in image related works and speed up scientific outputs with imaging techniques.
