# ImAG
ImAG represents Image Analysis Group. The motivation of forming such a group is to provide imaging users a platform to share their problems and solutions with others who might be interested. The goal of ImAG is to remove technical hurdles in image related works and speed scientific output with x-ray imaging techniques. The way to achieve this goal is to share useful codes, regardless of the programming language or level of programming sophistication, into a public repository for reuse by all.  The benefits should be multi-fold, as scientists may find that someone else has produced a tool to accomplish a needed task, thus saving reinvention of the wheel, while the author of the code could receive improvements to the functionality through expanded use.  We sincerely hope that ones efforts will be truly rewarded though citations and perhaps co-authorships in scientific literature. Eventually, we hope this respiratory will dynamically grow with accumulating open-source resource available to imaging users. 

ImAG is an interest group rather than a formal working group affiliated to an institution. The focus is primarily x-ray imaging, naturally associated with x-ray tomography and coherent imaging, though anything a member finds useful can be posted to the repository. Except of the hope to have ImAG become a platform for sharing and distribution of multi-dimensional image analysis tools, ImAG can also be used as a forum for researchers to discuss, collaborate, and organize professional meetings.
